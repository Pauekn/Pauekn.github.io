title: And here I thought I knew DNS
---

For many years now, I thought DNS was super simple. You basically just had a huge register with a lot of entries where a domain name pointed to an IP address. I knew it was possible to have multiple entries (or *"records"*) point to the same IP, but I always assumed this was the extent of its complexities. Turns out it wasn't quite that simple.

I have been curious about trying out Github Pages for quite some time, but I haven't really had anything to write about. I checked out how to use my own [Custom Domain Name](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/), and I saw reference to *CNAME* for the first time. I didn't realise it was related to DNS back then, but the name stuck with me. 

It was when I first looked at GitHub pages that I saw something called "CNAME". I didn't know it was related to DNS back then, but I later encountered CNAME (and other) possible records while trying to redirect my domain name to another host. This is when I started researching DNS.
